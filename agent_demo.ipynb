Hopkins ( 2013a ) developed a\\nsimple model for collapsing spherical clouds which assumes a con-\\nstant virial parameter (based on Robertson & Goldreich 2012 and\\nMurray & Chang 2015 ).7Of course, a perfectly spherical collapse\\nwould not drive turbulence, but any inhomogeneity in a ’roughly’\\nhomogenous media would be greatly ampliﬁed by the collapse\\nwhich will drive the turbulence. Instead of dealing with the mi-\\ncroscopic details our model assumes that virial equilibrium is real-\\nized between turbulence and gravity on the largest scale, thus the\\ncontraction is set by the rate of turbulent energy dissipation whose\\ncharacteristic time-scale is the crossing time τλ.
